				<div class="review">⭐⭐⭐ <br> I bought this as a joke but like why were the bags kinda good LOL</div>

				<div class="review">⭐⭐⭐⭐ <br> The bags were fairly sturdy if I do say so myself, and they also smelled like some really expensive perfume you'd go back to Sephora for just to keep reapplying instead of actually buying! (I'm aware I could've bought perfume with the amount I just spent on trashbags)</div>

				<div class="reviewer">Lisa Castle @lisaavcastle13</div>
				<div class="review">⭐⭐⭐ <br> If we're excluding pricepoint, the bags were fairly good quality, and did exactly what they were supposed to do! I think that deserves at least three stars.</div>

				<div class="review">⭐ <br> My significant other bought these, and in my opinion the price is a big part of the review... srry but I don't get payed enough to think $150 for five (5) trash bags is even remotely reasonable</div>
