			<h4>Gold-laced TP</h4>
			<p1>This toilet paper was specially crafted with microscopic flakes of 22 karat gold. The act of using screams indulgence and prestige, and we know what you're thinking--you may not be able to see it, but trust, they're there. (price is per roll)</p1>
			<p class="price"> $500.99 <br> <br> 23/50 remaining</p>
