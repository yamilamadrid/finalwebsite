				<div class="review">⭐⭐⭐ <br> I don't own sneakers in which I could replace the laces with these but they're really nice to look at as is!</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="reviewer">Olivia Carlson @oliviacarlson04</div>
				<div class="review">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ <br> The actual white lace part is really soft and definitely won't stain easily, the engrained feature on the aglet is really nice too! I wonder what it says</div>
			</li>

				<div class="reviewer">Brooke Pawlowski @smillie2323</div>
				<div class="review">⭐ <br> Now why did I think silk would ever be a good idea for laces</div>
			</li>

				<div class="reviewer">Helen LeBaron @7_HelenB_</div>
				<div class="review">⭐⭐ <br> If it came in other colors maybe I would reconsider the review, but these also stained really really easily and after several washes I can say that it likely will NOT be going back to that white.</div>

				<div class="reviewer">Zach Robison @zach.robison3 </div>
				<div class="review">⭐⭐⭐⭐ <br> The laces were pretty nice, and I was honestly just happy that two laces came together in a pack! I've bought items from this brand before in which the amount of items were unclear--this one was the most reasonable for sure</div>
